Elon Musk,@TeslaLisa,QUESTION....  Why are a zillion newbies getting a free month of V12 when all Legacy S/X owners who paid thousands can't get it?    Thanks 
Elon Musk,@GagliardiLou,"Elon, I can't believe how nice my new model y is. I don't understand why anyone would buy anything but a tesla. Maybe price would deter them, but I got a great deal on the model y. Best value out there, in my opinion."
Elon Musk,@derekhxw,"I just tried V12 for the first time with 12.3.2.1, wow! I have been an enthusiast since V8, but still V12 really wow me. "
Elon Musk,@TeslaXplored,Will that happen in the Nassau/Queens area of NY too? Seems to struggle here a lot. 
Elon Musk,@somi_teslagirl,Ive been sold on #FSD before I even got it in my 
Elon Musk,@BassonBrain,"it will be way better than a human, period ... already is!"
Elon Musk,@Avatrode,Seeing the progress achieved in FSD V12 .....In terms of safety and even considering only the financial prospect of robotaxi future income ... in my estimation .#Tesla #FSD is worth more now than the hardware value of my 2022 Model X Plaid.
Elon Musk,@RyanTanaka3,Thanks for helping make the future great
Elon Musk,@DaveWarnedYou,"Riding in a car is the most dangerous thing humans do every day, specifically because other human drivers are so bad and unpredictable."
Elon Musk,@2thdoc2012,I‚Äôve been thinking about that as I‚Äôve been testing v12.    It really is to a certain extent already like a personal taxi
Elon Musk,@CodingMark,"now that the machine is finally churning on a capable, future-proof architecture, progress should be unbelievable"
Elon Musk,@PhilFox43249797,"And Tesla has a multiyear advantage in this high margin, ‚Äúwinner take most‚Äù FSD business"
Elon Musk,@TeslaSynopsis,"Elon can FSD beta roll out be a bit faster, especially to cars that had been using FSD beta forever?"
Elon Musk,@roelsmelt,I‚Äôve told my kids that they most likely will not be allowed to get their driving license and drive their own cars on the road. Way to dangerous! 
Elon Musk,@01Ananto,By saying this now people will get drunk and then try FSD. Which not supervise by a human. Big statement Elon. Not a safe one. Cause 12.3 is still not 100% perfect.
Elon Musk,@WayneSn35339982,"I really don't want or like that. Perhaps if someone, you, would build a people carrier train of FSD's linked together to take the mindless where they want to go and drop them off along it's way, less traffic, so I can drive my 1949 Ford pickup ice 3 speed truck with no worries."
Elon Musk,@LizBurgess92677,I think i would put a breathalizer. Against the law to drive  DRUNKü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Elon Musk,@aikisteve,I assume that when FSD beta is rolled out in Europe it will be again starting with a very limited group of beta testers? Makes sense because of all the differences with the US and specifics per country
Elon Musk,@crossland_rob,I don't like to be the barer of bad news 
Elon Musk,@SnakeMannn,It will really be amazing how good 
Elon Musk,@BdPwll81,Well I will be that guy in the future that still has a gas guzzler in his garage ......I'd rather transport myself -- I would however love a ride in one of those rockets of yours. I hear you're close to breaking through the firmament....üòâ
Elon Musk,@DansTesla,Can‚Äôt wait to get V12‚Ä¶.my car has been downloading this for 3 days lol $tsla
Elon Musk,@schheng1,The improvements that the world of computing and engineering has brought to the way we live in North America have been incredible and mind-boggling. ü§Øü§©üöÄüôåüèªüëèüèªüç´üòòüí´
Elon Musk,@MemesOfMars,in Germany üá©üá™ the beta still has a lot of work ahead. One week it behaves ok the next it does weird things like trying to go on the exit lane even though the straight lane is super clearly marked.
Elon Musk,@LandonH,It‚Äôs crazy good. Thanks for all the great work 
Elon Musk,@oi8achevy,Speed management is still an issue. How are you going to deal with all the inaccurate speed limit map data? Even on v12 most of my drives in upstate NY are crippled by the system defaulting to 25mph on unmarked roads.
Elon Musk,@MelissaJeanSays,That sounds cool. But I still want a manual control option.
Elon Musk,@NickLippis,I love FSD.  It's part of living in exponential progress time.
Elon Musk,@GozukaraFurkan,I agree with this
Elon Musk,@NAlves_EJ,For the time being the question is how will that affect the sales outlook.
Elon Musk,@NAlves_EJ,Tesla's gearing up to drop its Q1 delivery figures. $TSLA
Elon Musk,@NSuresh_ECW,Legacy OEM's should licence Tesla FSD into their cars & rapidly progress towards Autonomous vehicles
Elon Musk,@alexisd3000,"If every car used FSD, the roads would be so much safer!  It‚Äôs the human drivers we need to look out for."
Elon Musk,@griffithe,NGL I watched 
Elon Musk,@Wisdom_MAPS,Thinking long term and continually investing in that...gives you these kinds of results!
Elon Musk,@aqsarani76,üëèüëèüëè It will be interesting when licenses and all the admin and bureaucracy is no longer necessary. It‚Äôs sure to be an interesting transformation. Not sure the Government will make this easy. ü§£
Elon Musk,@Jeremywmerchant,All future car purchases will require FSD in my family!
Elon Musk,@fyrewede,I will never trust FSD if for no other reason than that I don't trust other drivers (or other FSD vehicles). All ot takes is one loose tire hurtling towards my car through the air at speed.  I might manage to dodge it. I'm not certain FSD will.

Andrew Tate,@OMEGAMILLIONS1,Or they could have just used that 50 a month to add to their own allocated weekly dollar cost strategy and would still be up all alone bruv.
